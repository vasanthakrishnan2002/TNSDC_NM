# UrbanSound8K Audio Classification

This project focuses on classifying audio samples from the UrbanSound8K dataset into various urban sound categories using deep learning techniques.

## Problem Statement
The objective is to develop a model capable of accurately identifying urban sounds such as car horns, street music, and drilling, among others. This aids in tasks like urban noise monitoring and environmental sound analysis.

## Overview of Solutions
The solution involves implementing a deep learning model, specifically a feedforward neural network, to classify audio samples. The model is trained on features extracted from the audio data using techniques like Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs).

## Steps to Implement the Solution
1. **Data Preparation**
   - Utilize the UrbanSound8K dataset containing labeled sound excerpts from various urban environments.
   - Preprocess the audio data, extract relevant features, and prepare it for training.

2. **Model Architecture**
   - Design a feedforward neural network architecture suitable for audio classification.
   - Use MFCCs or other relevant features as input to the model.

3. **Training**
   - Train the neural network using the prepared audio data.
   - Utilize techniques like batch normalization and dropout to prevent overfitting.

4. **Evaluation**
   - Evaluate the model's performance on a separate test set using metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix.
   - Ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data and can effectively classify various urban sound categories.

5. **Optimization and Fine-Tuning**
   - Experiment with different model architectures, hyperparameters, and regularization techniques to improve performance.
   - Fine-tune the model based on evaluation results to achieve better accuracy and robustness.
